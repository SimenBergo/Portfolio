      <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>My name is Simen Toker√∏d Bergo, i am 24 years old and come from Jessheim. 
          I have always had a passion for technology and web in general, and thefore felt my study programme web development would suit me well.
          The passion has grown throughout the programme, and i enjoy working with both the front and back-end. 
          However, i find it particulary interesting to make useful and intuitive components. The constant evolution of technologies in the industry 
          also provide endless learning, which is fun.

        <p>
          One of my biggest passions is alpine skiing, and i trained and raced over a period of almost 15 years
          In the video below i am on vacation in the Italian alps, and while going straight down is not how we train, it is still fun.

        <p>Even though i enjoy it very much, some times accidents happen, as can be seen i the video below, where 
          myself and my club was supposed to parade with flags before a ski jumping contest in Holmenkollen, Oslo.
