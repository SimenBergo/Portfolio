          Even though we used very popular and mainstream technology for the project (MERN stack),
          the level of code understanding and efficiency could be higher in this project. This was the
          first project I used a framework like React, and it was obviously not perfect. This means there
          is a lot of code that could be rewritten and optimized, by for instance using functional
          components and hooks, instead of class components.

          The project was created at a time when I was still very new to making dynamic web pages
          connected to a back-end, and did not have the best understanding of the normal practices
          related to this. The system works according to the requirements, but there are major
          improvements that could be made to reduce cluttered, complicated code. Using other
          technologies could also make the development less time-consuming.

          When building this page, we did not have much knowledge of how to program in all the
          necessary javascript features. This meant it became a mess of over-complicated code, and it
          could have easily been simplified and optimized, to improve the performance of the page.

          This project was never tested with people outside of the group. Therefore, it is harder to say
          whether or not it is usable and accessible. Testing this with 4-5 test subjects could reveal
          problems that need fixing.
